# go_to_bed
This project is intend for CE DP2

## Description
We are building an alarm clock that try to make people sleep early

## How It Works
The alarm clock will monitor your phone status and environment lights. Once your light is off and your phone is not in use, the clock will consider you are asleep and record your sleep time. This sleep time will compare to others and produce peer pressure to push everyone to sleep on time

## Implementation
We will build the hardware device using raspberry pi zero w, and implement software using mainly Python
